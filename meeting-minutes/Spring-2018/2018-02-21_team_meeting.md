#### Attendees
- To-Do: Fill Out



-----
### Button maker (5 minutes)
- Alton: Set up system on reserve.cumaker.space to prompt students to register how many buttons they need. Set up a system to charge them shekels per X number of buttons. Make it a number that easily fit in bag or box that we have plenty of.
  - Still looking into it. Update by 2018-02-21.

### Incident de-incentivizing (5 minutes)
- Adjust question 4 on General Workshop Safety Quiz to say, "What is the correct response to an incident or injury?"
  - Answer: Alert an intern.
    - Audra: Change this in Canvas by 2018-02-21 and present to team.

### Inventory (15 minutes)
- Where are we on ordering a bulk order of filament from eSun?
- Is there a way to create email alerts when running low on a certain item of inventory?

### Customer Service (5 minutes)
- It is important to uphold the safety standard within the Space, but we also need to be nice and inviting to students. We want this to be a safe and comfortable environment where students always feel welcome to come and work. We need to be respectful and teach them nicely.
- Having students complain that they were not treated right by Makerspace employees is completely unacceptable. We are here for the students.

### Pictures (2 minutes)
- Interns need to keep up with taking pictures of cool creations made in the Space for our social media accounts and the Makerspace Website.
  - Would a short Google form for interns to fill out when they see something cool help?

### New Team Meeting (briefly)
- From this day on, all staff meetings will be Tuesday evenings from 8:30pm-9:30pm in Watt room ______.
- Remember that attendance at the staff meetings is a condition of your employment/appointment in leadership positions in the space. This change will make it easier for us to collaborate.
