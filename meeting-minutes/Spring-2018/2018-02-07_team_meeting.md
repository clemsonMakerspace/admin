- DO NOT LET PEOPLE BORROW STUFF WITHOUT A RESERVATION OR CHECKING WITH CHIP || OWEN
- If you have checked with Chip || Owen and gotten approval for a non-reservable thing then make sure the student sends an email to YOU and MAKERSPACE@CLEMSON.EDU with the following
    1. List of what they're borrowing
    2. Picture of EVERYTHING they're borrowing
    3. When they will return it
  - That intern that receives the email from the student, forward to all of the other interns.
- Please take notes on questions / concerns and direct them to Owen

#### Button maker (5 minutes)
- Alton: Set up system on reserve.cumaker.space to prompt students to register how many buttons they need. Set up a system to charge them shekels per X number of buttons. Make it a number that easily fit in bag or box that we have plenty of.

## Bookbags and Space Organization

## Communication

  - Official use -- refer to email

## Operations Manual
- Owen: start the first entries to set example of how to write. Then delegate to interns
- Dr. Todd suggested a single editor for the manual.
  - The editor receives text from interns, he/she edits then puts it into operations manual.
- Start an Operations Manual Folder in the Drive. Copy documents into the folder and transcribe it into the operations manual.
- Editor: Give report every week at staff meeting of the updates and assign as need be.
- As interns have questions, tell the editor and he/she will write it up and put it in the manual.
- Notetaker: Make notes of decisions in the meeting minutes.
- Owen: Make master outline of the manual
- Anyone adding info: Use suggestion tool in Google Drive to add the info.
- Interns without a delegated task from the staff meeting every week add info to the manual.
