### Reservation system (15 minutes)
- How to act on behalf of a user:
  1. Go to reserve.cumaker.space
  2. Click on "supervise"
  3. Student Management
  4. Blue arrow on the far right on the same row as their name.
  5. Now make the reservation as if you were doing it for yourself.
    - MAKE SURE to stop acting on their behalf after you finish!
      - Top right, click on their name and it will notify you that you stopped acting on their behalf.
- Interns: Make sure that the name of the student matches the email used to make the reservation.
  - There have been a few instances this past week of this not being the case. We need to make sure it stops.
    - This is VERY important for our statistics to receive funding
      - Same thing for the print log
- Need to make clear on reserve system that students need to make their own reservations.
  - Yan-Jing: Update this info by 2018-02-21.
    - Also create a paragraph on how to update policies on this system and send to all interns.

### Button maker (5 minutes)
- Alton: Set up system on reserve.cumaker.space to prompt students to register how many buttons they need. Set up a system to charge them shekels per X number of buttons. Make it a number that easily fit in bag or box that we have plenty of.
  - Still looking into it. Update by 2018-02-21.

### Incident de-incentivizing (10 minutes)
- How can we de-incentivize students from going to the bathroom after an incident to clean up?
  - Students need to go to Room 112 with an intern to treat injury.
    - Document in Operations manual.
- Document that both first-aid kits be shown in intern training.
  -  Document in the 0perations manual as well as the training matrix.
- Adjust question 4 on General Workshop Safety Quiz to say, "What is the correct response to an incident or injury?"
  - Answer: Alert an intern.
    - Audra: Change this in Canvas by 2018-02-21 and present to team.

### Inventory (15 minutes)
- Demo from Andrew
  - Made a write-up on the Drive of how to use partkeepr.
    - Inventory folder in the Drive
  - Important to make a comment when updating inventory. Otherwise, it goes undocumented.
- This is the new system. We no longer will use the inventory system set up previously from the Google Drive.
- This is the most updated system currently.

- This is important to keep a better visual of inventory and when we need to reorder items.
