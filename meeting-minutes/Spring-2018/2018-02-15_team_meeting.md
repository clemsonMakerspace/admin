  5. Now make the reservation as if you were doing it for yourself.
    - MAKE SURE to stop acting on their behalf after you finish!
      - Top right, click on their name and it will notify you that you stopped acting on their behalf.
- Interns: Make sure that the name of the student matches the email used to make the reservation.
  - There have been a few instances this past week of this not being the case. We need to make sure it stops.
    - This is VERY important for our statistics to receive funding
      - Same thing for the print log
